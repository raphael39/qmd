# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my tale of survival during the summer semester of 2024 at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). This book is a collection of stories, mishaps, and the occasional epiphany that I encountered while navigating the chaos of deadlines, lectures, while working full time at an internship and way too much coffee. If you're looking for inspiration, you might be in the wrong place—but if you want a good laugh at my expense, you're definitely in the right one. Here’s to the ups, downs, and everything in between that made this semester unforgettable!
